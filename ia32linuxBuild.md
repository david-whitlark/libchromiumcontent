# build requirements

* A 64-bit Intel machine with at least 8GB of RAM. More than 16GB is highly recommended.
* At least 100GB of free disk space.
* You must have Git and Python (2.7.*) installed already.

# one-time setup

run linuxBootstrap.sh - this will invoke src/build/install-build-deps.sh from chromium

# build libchromiumcontent

run ia32linuxBuild.sh

# on a successful build

you should see a folder /ia32dist/
